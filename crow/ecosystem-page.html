          <h2>Crows in natural ecosystems</h2>
          <div>Crows are known for being particularly intelligent no matter what area of the world they live in. When it comes to living in the woods or other natural habitats here are just a few of the behaviors that help us see just how intelligent they truly are. Crow nests are some of the hardest nests for people to find due to Crows being extremely quiet around their nests keeping them hidden. When predators do come to attack the crows, the crows are known for using a method of defense called mobbing. According to Dominey, Wallace J. "Mobbing in animals is an antipredator adaptation in which individuals of prey species mob a predator by cooperatively attacking or harassing it, usually to protect their offspring. A simple definition of mobbing is an assemblage of individuals around a potentially dangerous predator."  Finally, the crow will mate for life and is one of the few birds that will return to the nest if mating and nesting don't go well the first year they are on their own. This very communal lifestyle helps them in all aspects of their life. From self-defense, mobbing, to growing their own brood, mating.</div>

        <h2>Crows in urban ecosystems</h2>
          <div>Crows in the urban ecosystem are very different from the crows that live in the wilderness, but their intelligence is what will keep them alive in both environments. Crows feeding habits in an urban environment illustrate this point best. When most of the murderer will drop onto the street or sidewalk to start feeding. There will always be a couple on nearby trees or other high outcroppings to look for predators. Crows also have the ability to recognize human faces and will teach other crows which humans are safe and which are not. Furthermore, Crows are known for their ability to use tools in the wild, so when it comes to moving plastic to get to the food in a trash can they are more than prepared. </div>
