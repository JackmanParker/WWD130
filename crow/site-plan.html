        Crows know for their prominent role in gothic horror and bad luck within
        the practice of astrology. The Crow is a bird in the corvid family. They
        are characterised by long black feathers and a particularly loud harsh
        caw. What do they do for us here in the world? They are a natural part
        of the food chain. They also are useful when it comes to helping keep
        the world clean, from trash eating to carcasses they keep the
        environment clean and moving forward.

      <h3>Crows in ecosystem</h3>
      <p>
        The questions I plan to get from visitors will be a mix of three kinds
        of questions. First I image I will get a lot of questions about the need
        for crows in general. Many people view them as a nuisance That needs to
        be eliminated from the local wildlife. Those questions will go very well
        with questions of the role the crow plays in the environment and how we
        as humans will continue to benefit from sparing them.

      <h3>Crows in popculture</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the last kind of questions that I will be receiving from the
        visitors of the website will be people looking into what role the Crow
        has played in a religious and mythical standpoint in the world. I plan
        on having a portion of the website dedicated to this kind of history.
