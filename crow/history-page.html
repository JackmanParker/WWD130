          <h2>Crows in ancient history</h2>
          <div>
            Crows were used mostly as a symbol of intelligence and love in
            ancient societies. The two biggest celebrators of this bird are
            Egypt and Greece. Egypt saw that they were monogamous and used them
            as the icon of love. They also saw how they would drop nuts from
            high up onto stone buildings to break nuts as a form of innovation
            and Intellectual reasoning. Greece thought so fondly of crows that
            they would even have them represent deities in the form of Appolo
            the God of prophecy and Athena the Goddess of wisdom. They strove to
            compare to this strong bird

          <h2>Crows in modern history</h2>
          <div>
            Katarina SamuroviÄ‡ avid Crow Journalist explains "Crows have been
            seen as a countryside nuisance for a long time. Due to their
            frequent foraging of crops and cases of attacks on newborn livestock
            especially lambs crows have had a bad reputation for centuries and
            were frequently persecuted and killed. Hunting non-migratory birds
            damaging to agriculture is still legal in some states. However, in
            the cities, there is no agriculture and no imminent reasons for the
            mistreatment of crows." Crows have also become one of the most
            debated animals of whether it is a pest or a blessing for us today.
            Tokyo is a fantastic example. They suffer from crows ripping into
            the trash and making messes normally. cities in the United States
            that use garbage cans and bins find that crows can't get in so they
            eat the litter cleaning up the streets.

          <h2>Crows in Mythology</h2>
          <div>
            Crows in Native American folklore are viewed as trickster gods
            similar to coyotes. They are also so well renowned in the native
            cultures that some are called crow tribes out of reverence for the
            bird. In Celtic Mythology three crows together are the harbinger of
            death and the eyes and ears of the god of death. Morrighan the
            warrior Goddess regularly appears as a crow in many Celtic myths as
            well. In many fantasy and gothic literature, the crow is what a
            witch, wizard, or other evil characters will become to evade capture
            due to the bird actually being difficult to capture in real life.
